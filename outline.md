# Pharoah
## Game Outline

The general idea is that a user starts off as an everyday normal person. Has no special privileges, is poor etc..
As the player progresses through the game and more stats are acquired they will rise in rank, the goal is to reach the final rank of pharoah.


Use probability, some randomness, and assign skills randomly when the character starts.
Use graphs to connect choices and people they've made/met to an outcome to become pharoah.


The player can start randomly in certain positions, along with random skills. (maybe he's born a slave, maybe a removed nobles grandson, maybe he's born with special abilities/etc..)


Skills to be issued upon spawning/creation. Suppose a received the beginning was 'intuition' or possibly 'clairvoyance' and at random. One of the higher ups needs advice for the pharoah and asks you, and you have to make a solid prediction based on history or getting random dreams of what might happen.
